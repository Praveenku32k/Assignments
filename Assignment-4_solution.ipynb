    "\n",
    "Indexing and Slicing:\n",
    "Both lists and strings can be accessed using indexing and slicing. Indexing allows you to access individual elements or characters by their position within the sequence, and slicing allows you to extract a portion of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterability:\n",
    "Both lists and strings can be iterated over using loops. You can use constructs like for loops to iterate through each element or character in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Length:\n",
    "Both lists and strings have a length, which is the number of elements or characters they contain. You can obtain the length using the len() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concatenation:\n",
    "Both lists and strings can be concatenated using the + operator. For lists, concatenation combines the elements of two or more lists into a single list. For strings, concatenation combines the characters of two or more strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repetition:\n",
    "Both lists and strings support repetition using the * operator. You can create a new sequence that consists of multiple copies of the original sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Operator:\n",
    "Both lists and strings support the in operator, which allows you to check if a certain value or character is present in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutability and Mutability:\n",
    "While strings are immutable (their characters cannot be changed once created), lists are mutable (their elements can be modified after creation). This is a significant difference between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these similarities, it's important to note that there are also key differences between lists and strings due to their distinct data types and properties. For example, lists can store a variety of different data types, while strings store sequences of characters. Lists have methods like append() and remove() for manipulation, whereas strings have methods like upper() and `lower\n"
