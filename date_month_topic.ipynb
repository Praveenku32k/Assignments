    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a mechanism where a class can inherit attributes and methods from another class. It's used for code reuse and building specialized classes. A base class (superclass) defines common features, and derived classes (subclasses) inherit these while adding unique attributes and methods. In Python, class Derived(Base) expresses inheritance. It promotes modularity and polymorphism, enhancing flexibility and reducing redundancy in code."

    "Single Inheritance:\n",
    "Single inheritance refers to a class inheriting attributes and methods from only one base class (superclass). In other words, a derived class extends a single parent class. This simplifies the class hierarchy, making it straightforward to understand and maintain. It encourages a clear and linear structure in which each class inherits from one ancestor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Easier to comprehend and troubleshoot due to a straightforward hierarchy.\n",
    "Reduced Complexity: Limits conflicts and ambiguity in method resolution order.\n",
    "Code Reuse: Encourages modular design and helps avoid excessive dependencies.\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "Multiple inheritance involves a class inheriting from more than one base class. This allows a derived class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple sources. While it enhances code reuse and flexibility, it can lead to complications such as the \"diamond problem\" â€“ a conflict when two base classes share a common ancestor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reuse: Enables the incorporation of functionalities from multiple sources.\n",
    "Flexibility: Allows creating classes with diverse features by combining traits from different classes.\n",
    "Polymorphism: Supports creating classes with versatile behaviors.\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance: One base class is inherited, leading to a linear class hierarchy.\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance: Multiple base classes are inherited, forming a more complex hierarchy.\n",
    "Both types offer distinct benefits, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of the project. Single inheritance simplifies the structure, while multiple inheritance provides greater flexibility at the cost of potential complications."
